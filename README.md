# CSV to Cassandra SSTable

Converts a CSV file into SSTables that can be bulkloaded into a Cassandra cluster

## Installation

Make sure that maven is installed on your system. Then to build the jar file, run:

    $ ./build

## Usage

When running csv-to-sstable.jar, you need to specify the keyspace for which you want to generate the SSTables, the absolute path to a CQL file containing the "TABLE CREATE" definition of the Cassandra table that you want to populate and the absolute path to your CSV file:

    $ java -jar csv-to-sstable.jar <keyspace> <absolute/path/to/schema.cql> <absolute/path/to/input.csv> <absolute/path/to/output/dir> [optional csv prefs]

Optionally, you can pass CSV Preferences in JSON format. Omitting this parameter is equivalent to passing the following default preferences:
    
    $ java -jar csv-to-sstable.jar <keyspace> <absolute/path/to/schema.cql> <absolute/path/to/input.csv> <absolute/path/to/output/dir> '{"col_sep":",", "quote_char":"\""}'

Note that the quotes in your JSON must be escaped (as in the example above) in order to be passed on the command line.

## Example

Suppose you would like to populate a Cassandra table `my_table` within a keyspace `my_keyspace`.  The CQL definition of `my_table` is stored in `~/my_table.cql` and might look like this:

```cql
CREATE TABLE my_keyspace.my_table (
    my_column1 text,
    my_column2 int,
    my_column3 set<text>,
    my_column4 timestamp,
    PRIMARY KEY (my_column2, my_column1)
);
```

Assuming you want to use a CSV file `my_csv.csv` in your home directory to populate your table, you can run:

    $ java -jar csv-to-sstable.jar my_keyspace /Users/home/my_table.cql /Users/home/my_csv.csv /Users/home/sstables


After the SSTables have been generated, you can bulkload them into Cassandra by using sstableloader. Assuming that you have a running local Cassandra cluster installed in ~/cassandra, run:

    $ ~/cassandra/bin/sstableloader -d localhost Users/home/sstables/my_keyspace/my_table

## Supported column types:

Currently, only a limited number of column types are supported:

Cassandra column type  | Example CSV column
---------------------- | --------------------
text   | 'My Little Text'
float  | '8.97'
int    | '3'
boolean | 'True'
set&lt;text&gt; | '["first", "second", "third"]'
